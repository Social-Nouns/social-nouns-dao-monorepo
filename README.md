## Contributing

If you're interested in contributing to Nouns DAO repos we're excited to have you. Please discuss any changes in `#developers` in [discord.gg/nouns](https://discord.gg/nouns) prior to contributing to reduce duplication of effort and in case there is any prior art that may be useful to you.

The [nouns contracts](packages/nouns-contracts) is the suite of Solidity contracts powering Nouns DAO.

### nouns-sdk

### nouns-subgraph

In order to make retrieving more complex data from the auction history, [nouns subgraph](packages/nouns-subgraph) contains subgraph manifests that are deployed onto [The Graph](https://thegraph.com).
